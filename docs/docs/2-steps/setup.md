## Prerequisites

In order to use Fable you will need the following tools:

- [.NET Core SDK 6.0]([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)) to work with F# files and dependencies
  - be sure to set this in your [global.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) if you're having trouble
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to execute JS code
- A JS package manager, like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (which comes with Node) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Having the above tools, you may consider using [Femto](https://fable.io/blog/2019/2019-06-29-Introducing-Femto.html) to ease package management.

## Development tools

Basically you will need an editor that lets you code in F# with features like hints on hover, autocomplete, syntax highlighting and so on... and there are many of them to suit your code styling!
