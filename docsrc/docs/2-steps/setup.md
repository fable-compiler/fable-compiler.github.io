## Prerequisites

In order to use Fable you will need the following tools:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to work with F# files and dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to execute JS code
- A JS package manager, like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (which comes with Node) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Development tools

Basically you will need an editor that lets you code in F# with features like hints on hover, autocomplete, syntax highlighting and so on... and there are many of them to suit your code styling!
